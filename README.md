# Feld-s-Friendship-Paradox

## Problem Statement

This assignment explores Scott Feld's friendship paradox in social networks using network generation algorithms in Python's networkx module. Feld's paradox suggests that, on average, a random person's friends will have more friends than the person themselves.

## Solution
Implemented a Python script for Assignment 4, using the networkx module to create a network of 100 nodes with Erdos-Renyi graph generation. Calculated the mean of friends' friends for each node, compared individuals' friends with their friends' friends, and identified well-connected individuals. The Scott Feldâ€™s friendship paradox held around 85% for rare connections (p=1%) and 47% for denser connections (p=90%). Concluded that the paradox is more prevalent in networks with rare connections and diminishes in complete graphs.
